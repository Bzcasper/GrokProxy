## 🔌 Fetching Gork Cookies

1. Go to the [Gork official website](https://x.ai/) and register or log in to your account.
2. Start a new chat session and press **F12** to open the browser Developer Console.
3. Send any message to the AI to generate a request using your cookie.
4. Navigate to the **Network** tab in the Developer Console.
5. Look for a request named **"new"** or **"responses"** and click on it.
6. Find the _Cookies_ section and look for an entry starting with **"sso="** (e.g., `sso=xdfdafAftda.sastwer... ;`).
7. Copy the **entire value up to the semicolon (`;`)** and save it for later use in the configuration file.

## 🛠️ Installation & Deployment

> ❗️ **Note**: Your deployment environment must be in a region where Gork services are officially available; otherwise, responses may not work properly!

You can deploy with **Docker** or **Docker Compose**. Follow the steps below to set up the proxy.

### ❇️ Clone from GitHub

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CNFlyCat/GrokProxy.git
```

### 📝 Configure the Settings

Open the `cookies.yaml` file and configure your cookies and authentication password:

```sh
sudo nano cookies.yaml
```

```yaml
cookies:
  - "sso=AAAAAA-xxxxx"
  - "sso=fasdfas-xxxxx"
password: "your_password"
```

---

## 📦 Deploy Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

### Modify the Docker Compose Configuration (Optional)

Modify the `ports` settings to change the port mapping as needed:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: grokproxy
    ports:
      - "8080:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./cookies.yaml:/app/cookies.yaml
```

### Build the Project

```sh
docker-compose build
```

### Start the Project

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## 🐳 Deploy Using Docker

> **Note**: The following commands must be executed inside the project directory.

### Build the Project

```sh
docker build -t grokproxy .
```

### Run the Project

```sh
docker run -d -p 8080:8000 -v ./cookies.yaml:/app/cookies.yaml grokproxy
```

---

## 🌐 Ngrok Integration (External Access)

The proxy includes built-in ngrok support for secure external HTTPS access.

### Setup Ngrok

1. **Add your ngrok auth token to `.env`:**

   ```bash
   NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

2. **Start services:**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Get your public URL:**

   ```bash
   ./get_ngrok_url.sh
   ```

4. **Monitor traffic:**
   Visit `http://localhost:4040` for the ngrok dashboard

---

## 📖 Using the Proxy

🎉 Now, you can use OpenWebUI or any OpenAI API-compatible AI frontend.

- **Local:** `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1`
- **Remote:** `http://(your_domain_or_IP):8080/v1`
- **Ngrok:** `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/v1`

Enter your configured password or API key when prompted. Then, send a test message – If everything is set up correctly, you will receive a response from Gork! 🚀

### ⚠️ Cookie Maintenance

Cloudflare cookies expire regularly (1-2 hours). If you see "Request rejected by anti-bot rules" errors:

1. Follow the [Cookie Refresh Guide](COOKIE_REFRESH_GUIDE.md)
2. Update `cookies.yaml` with fresh cookies
3. Restart: `docker compose restart grokproxy`
